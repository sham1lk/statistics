Implement an optimization algorithm called
Simulated Annealing (SA). It is based on sampling and the optimization procedure is similar to the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm. Because the optimization is based on sampling, SA allows to optimize even non-differentiable
functions, and thus it is applicable to optimizing combinatorial problems.
